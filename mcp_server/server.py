"""MCP server wrapping minio-aiops operations (stdio transport).

Thin adapter layer: each ``@mcp.tool()`` function (in ``mcp_server/tools/``)
delegates to the ``minio_aiops`` ops package and is wrapped with the
minio-aiops ``@governed_tool`` harness (audit / budget / undo / risk-tier).

Standalone, self-governed MinIO object-storage operations (preview): capacity
RCA, bucket exposure audit, ILM gap analysis, healing health, guarded writes.
