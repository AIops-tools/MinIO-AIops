"""Shared MCP server primitives: the FastMCP instance, connection helper,
error sanitisation, and the ``@tool_errors`` decorator.

Tool modules under ``mcp_server/tools/`` import ``mcp`` from here and register
their ``@mcp.tool()`` functions onto it. ``mcp_server/server.py`` then imports
those modules and runs the server.

Keep ``Optional[X]`` (never PEP 604 ``X | None``) in any FastMCP-reflected
tool signature — on older mcp/pydantic the union eval'd to ``types.UnionType``
crashes FastMCP's ``issubclass`` check.
